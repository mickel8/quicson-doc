Along with QUIC there come a new HTTP protocol version called HTTP/3.
Both of them are not standardized yet but there are more and more
IETF drafts describing these protocols.
The last one was published on February and expires on August~\cite{http3-ietf}.
A lot of companies and scientists explores and tests QUIC and HTTP/3
features.
For example in~\cite{quic-master-thesis} QUIC was tested in terms of performance under
network congestion.
Therefor it is important to continuously examine new implementations
and their.
