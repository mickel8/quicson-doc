\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:abstract}

The goal of this thesis is to examine usefulness of QUIC transport protocol
in an interactive communication.
QUIC is a new transport protocol based on UDP protocol.
With it there comes new HTTP version - HTTP/3.
Both QUIC and HTTP/3 are not standardize yet but there exists some implementations
of IETF draft versions which are successfully used in the production.
Therefore it is a good moment to examine if QUIC suits well
and gains new advantages in an interactive communication
in which neither TCP nor UDP protocols perform well enough.
In this purposes Rust implementation of QUIC has been chosen.
Results include comparision between TCP and QUIC protocols in terms
of performance e.g.~connection setup time and reliability.
